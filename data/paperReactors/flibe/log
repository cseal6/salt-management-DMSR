The use of uranium metal, for now, is assumed to be composed solely of U235 and U238.
Starting the refuelling simulation at Sun Mar  5 15:19:37 2017
First input file is being refuelled at 0.211741724568 ccm/s.
No Z to charge dict assigned to mod since it wont have any mass flows.
No Z to charge dict assigned to tank since it wont have any mass flows.
adding material offgas to input file. assuming empty tank of volume 1e6.
assuming Umetal is treated compressibly, it shouldnt be present in
any neutronics calculations if so!
iterating on fuel enrichment to go critical.
